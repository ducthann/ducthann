- 👋 Hello! I'm Duc-Than Nguyen. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at UIC.
- 👀 I enjoy writing proofs and programs, particularly when using the Coq proof assistant to write programs as proofs. 
- 🔬 My main research interests lie in logics and semantics of programming languages, as well as formal verification. 
- 💞️ I primarily utilize the Coq proof assistant, which defines programs, specifies their behavior, and proves that programs meet their specifications.
