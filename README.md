I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at UIC. My primary research interest lies in advancing the field of provably correct software. I focus on program semantics and correctness, with a particular emphasis on concurrent systems. Currently, I work on techniques for verifying the correctness of concurrent C programs using VST and Iris. My goal is to prove the correctness of realistic concurrent systems code and to develop simpler, more compositional approaches to reasoning about fine-grained concurrency.
