My primary research interest lies in advancing provably correct software, with a focus on developing and applying formal verification techniques for concurrent programs. In particular, I am developing techniques to verify the correctness of concurrent C programs using the Verified Software Toolchain and Iris, with the goal of proving the correctness of realistic systems-level concurrent code and developing simpler, more scalable approaches to reasoning about fine-grained concurrency.
