👋 Hello! I'm Duc-Than Nguyen (he/him). I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at UIC.

🔬 I'm focused on advancing provably correct software, specializing in the semantics and correctness of concurrent programs.

👀 I enjoy writing both proofs and programs, especially when using the Rocq/Coq proof assistant to develop programs as proofs.

💞️ Currently, I'm working on techniques to prove the correctness of concurrent C programs using the Verified Software Toolchain and Iris.
