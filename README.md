👋 Hello! I'm Duc-Than Nguyen. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at UIC.

🔬 My main interest is pushing the boundaries of provably correct software. I focus on the semantics and correctness of programs, particularly concurrent programs.

👀 I enjoy writing both proofs and programs, especially when using the Coq proof assistant to develop programs as proofs.

💞️ Currently, I'm working on techniques to prove the correctness of concurrent C programs using the Verified Software Toolchain and Iris.
